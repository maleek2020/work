My graphql is bring out errors which am yet to fix so i input the data at ./srs/data.js and it working perfectly.

The filter buttons and the search engine are working fine.

I'm yet to input the date filter but they are at the ./src/data.js already.

I got disturb by the heavy rain fall that why i have limted timme to attend to the project.

i will appreciate if more time is given so i will make the graphql api work fine and add the date filter.

Thank You very much.
